        <p> Hello! My name is Brian Shevin Dola and I am from Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
        <p> I enjoy playing basketball and spending time with someone I love the most.</p>
        <P> Have always loved the game, but it has not been without its sacrifices.</P>
        <P> In high school, I used to eat lunch with my English teacher because I did not have a core group of friends to sit with since I was always playing basketball.</P>
        <P> Before I was even born it seemed it was in my destiny to be a basketball player.</P>
        <P> My mom won a high school state championship and was some kind of legend in town.</P>
        <P> I still had aspirations of playing at a higher level, but my confidence was completely shaken when I did not make varsity basketball as a freshman.</P>
        <P> There were four freshman who had been invited to play fall ball with the varsity team from the year before and I was the only one who did not make varsity.</p>
